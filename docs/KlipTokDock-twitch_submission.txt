KlipTok is a website that tracks Twitch clips and allows users to search and discover clips from some of their favorite streamers.

To use this extension, the Twitch channel that will host the panel must be opted-in to KlipTok for monitoring.  A user can join their channel to KlipTok by visiting KlipTok.com and logging in with their Twitch account.  Once logged in, they can verify their opted-in status on kliptok.com/status

For channels already opted-in to KlipTok, you will be able to see their clips at kliptok.com/CHANNEL_NAME.  In the case of our sample URL, you can see csharpfritz's clips on KlipTok at https://kliptok.com/csharpfritz

No additional configuration is necessary, as the extension will use the hosted channel's id to load relevant statistics to show in the panel.

This extension shows the names of the Twitch community members who have created the clips with the most views on this channel.  Additionally, there is a second view under the "Clips by Day of the Week" link that shows a radar chart with columns for the number of clips created on this channel each day of the week.

KlipTok is a website that tracks Twitch clips and allows users to search and discover clips from some of their favorite streamers.

To use this extension effectively, the Twitch channel that will host the panel must:

1. Opt-in to KlipTok for monitoring 
2. Have clips available on Twitch to be interacted with.  

A user can join their channel to KlipTok by visiting KlipTok.com and logging in with their Twitch account.  For channels opted-in to KlipTok, you will be able to see their clips at kliptok.com/CHANNEL_NAME.  In the case of our sample URL, you can see csharpfritz's clips on KlipTok at https://kliptok.com/csharpfritz

No additional configuration is necessary, as the extension will use the hosted channel's id to load relevant statistics to show in the panel.

This extension shows the names of the Twitch community members who have created the clips with the most views on this channel.  Additionally, there is a second view under the "Clips by Day of the Week" link that shows a radar chart with columns for the number of clips created on this channel each day of the week.
